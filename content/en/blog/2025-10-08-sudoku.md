I want to write an article explaining how sudoku can demonstrate quantum mechanics concepts like superposition, collapse, multiverse theory, Schrödinger's experiment, and entanglement. I'll be using the code in the attachment. For now, I just want to draft a plan of the article with section/part/paragraph names:

## Article Structure Plan

### 1. Particle in Collapsed State
- Start with one cell in sudoku with only one possible hint/state
- When we click on the cell, we observe that state (1 is set as value)

### 2. Particle in Superposition
- Now particle (cell) exists in superposition of two states
- When we click on it, we observe either 1 or 2
- Repeat this a few times so readers can grasp the idea

### 3. Two Non-Entangled Particles
- Two particles (cells) with 2 possible states (both in superposition)
- Click each cell and both can collapse to either 1 or 2

### 4. Introduction to Sudoku Rules
- Explain that each row, column, and section should contain each number only once
- Start with 2x1 case, then 2x2 (with one section), then 2x2 with 4 sections
- Explain that in this universe, these particles are considered to be entangled

#### 4.0. 3x3 Case with 9 Sections
- Mention hidden states (the right answer)
- Note that in normal sudoku there is no superposition - outcome is defined
- Show that even 2x2 (1 section) we can reveal outcome in different ways
- We perceive it as entangled only because we cannot grasp the solution instantly due to cognitive limitations

#### 4.1. Hidden States in Normal Sudoku
- There is a hidden state in normal sudoku
- We can try to observe (randomly choose) and fixate state only after we click on cell

### 5. Two Entangled Particles (2x1 - 1 Section)
- As soon as we click the first particle, the second one collapses to the opposite state

### 6. Entangled Particles with 4 States
- Same for 2 entangled particles but states can be 4 instead of 2
- This introduces partial superposition or weak superposition
- Once we click on entangled particle, the other will have only 3 remaining hints

#### 6.1. Partial Observation (Optional)
- Introduce partial observation concept
- Imagine 2 particles with 4 states each
- Click on one - removes 2 states from one particle and 2 opposite states from another
- They still remain in superposition
- There should be some term in physics for this

### 7. Multiverse Concept
- 2x1 (entangled 1 section 2 states) - click on 1 cell and it reveals the second one
- Discuss ideas about:
  - Hidden state we don't know about
  - Random choice (no hidden state) and non-deterministic universe
  - The moment we observe (click) particle, we create 2 universes with different outcomes
  - In this case, the multiverse is deterministic

### 8. Schrödinger's Cat
- Once we observe outcome, it collapses superposition
- What if this observation happened in a closed room?
- We zoom out from 2 possible outcomes and it becomes hints in a larger cell (room)

#### 8.1. Restoration of Superposition
- Discuss restoration of superposition by erasing state

### 9. Tree of Future Outcomes
- Unsolved puzzle represents present
- We move towards solution with different choices (setting states, or revealing states)
- This represents the tree of future outcomes
- If there is a solution - there is a tree that converges
- If there is no solution - the tree splits without converging

### 10. Defined Final State (Solution)
- Pivot: now talk about defined final state (solution)
- Unsolved puzzle is past
- Each time we reveal a cell, we reveal states of entangled particles
- We eventually come to the same solution with different paths
- Take solution and start slowly entangling particles until we move to the past
- Then start the game
- We don't see the solution but it exists
- Good thing: we will come to the solution eventually no matter what we do
- Mention that we might actually move back in time to the solution

### 11. Scripted Universe and Cyclical Creation
- If solution exists - we can say we're in a scripted game where no matter what we do, we'll reach the scripted end
- Start of sudoku is where most uncertainty exists
- End is most certainty
- This final state might be the thing that created the past and the universe itself
- It hides itself in the future knowing that it will be "reborn"

### 12. Multiple Outcomes and Reality Sliding
- There can be few predefined outcomes or no final states
- In case of multiverse, we'll see all possible outcomes
- Each one of us slides through multiple (enormous amount) different realities
- Somewhere there will be a "solution" from previous step
- This will create universe and its past once again
- The cycle will continue

### Additional
- We need to add multipartite entanglement case into the mix with 3x1 (1 section 3 hints)
