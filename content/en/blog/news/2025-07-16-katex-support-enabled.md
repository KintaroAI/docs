We're excited to announce that **KaTeX support** has been enabled on the KintaroAI documentation site!

## What's New

You can now write mathematical formulas and chemical equations directly in your documentation using LaTeX syntax:

### Inline Math
Use single dollar signs: `\(E = mc^2\)` \(E = mc^2\)

### Block Math
Use double dollar signs for larger equations:
```
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
```
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$


### Chemical Equations
KaTeX can render chemical equations:
```
$$
2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O
$$
```
$$
2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O
$$

## Try It Out

Visit our [Math Test Page](/docs/math-test/) to see examples of mathematical formulas, chemical equations, and complex expressions in action.

This enhancement makes it much easier to document mathematical concepts, algorithms, and scientific content on our platform!
