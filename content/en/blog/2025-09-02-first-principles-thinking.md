# **First Principles Thinking: What It Is and How to Find Fundamental Truths**

**First principles thinking** is a problem-solving approach that involves breaking down complex problems into their most basic, foundational elements and then building solutions up from those fundamentals. In other words, it means going back to the *root truths* we are sure of, and reasoning upward from there [^1]. A *first principle* itself is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced from any other assumption [^2]. By starting with these bedrock truths, we can approach problems with fresh thinking unbound by existing conventions.

This mode of thinking is often described as "thinking like a scientist" – questioning every assumption and asking **what do we know for sure?** [^3]. It requires digging down to the core facts or principles and then using those to reconstruct knowledge. First principles thinking has been famously advocated by innovators like Elon Musk, who explained that instead of reasoning by analogy (doing things simply because that's how they've been done before), one should *"boil things down to the most fundamental truths ... and then reason up from there"* [^4] [^5]. This approach can lead to radically original solutions, because you're rebuilding understanding from the ground up rather than tweaking existing models.

In this article, we’ll explore what first principles thinking means through examples, and discuss how to identify fundamental principles in practice. We’ll also look at how to know if you’ve found the “right” first principles (or at least a good enough approximation) for a given problem. Finally, we’ll consider how first principles operate not just in technology and science, but even in our personal thinking and values – the “core beliefs” that act as first principles in our lives.

## **Example 1: Understanding Computers from First Principles (Aliens and the Turing Machine)**

Imagine an alien civilization visits Earth. These aliens have advanced space travel, but their technology is **biological** – they grow organic machines and structures instead of building devices. They have no concept of electronic computers. Upon encountering a personal computer, they find it utterly perplexing. They can tell it’s a machine capable of “thinking” (performing computations), but they have no frame of reference for *how* it works since they’ve never seen anything like it.

There are countless mysteries for our aliens: the box gets hot when powered on – is it supposed to, or is it sick? There’s a large fan whirring – is that a cooling mechanism or something else? Why is there a detachable box (the power supply or battery) and what does it do? What about that screen that lights up (perhaps they don’t even see the same light spectrum, so it appears blank to them)? The aliens could poke and prod the computer and maybe determine which parts are critical (they might figure out the central processing unit is important, for example, because without it the machine won’t run). But without additional context, they are essentially reverse-engineering a vastly complex system blindly. A modern CPU contains billions of transistors – even if the aliens had tools to inspect it, they wouldn’t know **why** those tiny components are there or what the overarching design is meant to do.

Now, suppose along with the computer, the aliens find a note explaining that *this machine is a real-world implementation of an abstract concept called a "Turing Machine."* The note provides a brief definition of a Turing machine. Suddenly, the aliens have a **first principle** for modern computers: the idea of a Turing Machine – a simple, theoretical model of computation. A Turing machine consists of an endless tape (for memory), a head that reads and writes symbols on the tape, and a set of simple rules for how the head moves and modifies the symbols [^6]. It's an incredibly **simple** device in principle, yet "despite the model's simplicity, it is capable of implementing any computer algorithm" [^7]. In fact, the Turing machine is the foundational concept behind all modern computers – any computer, from a calculator to a supercomputer, is essentially a more complex, practical embodiment of a universal Turing machine.

*One implementation example is Mike Davey’s physical Turing machine, which shows that a universal tape-and-head device can, in principle, perform any computation a modern computer can-just much more slowly.*

At first, this knowledge doesn’t immediately solve the aliens’ problem – they still don’t understand the PC’s circuitry. However, **now they have a guiding principle**. Knowing the computer is based on a Turing machine, the aliens can try to *build their own computing device from first principles*. They would start with the abstract idea of a tape and a moving head that reads/writes symbols (the essence of the Turing machine) and attempt to implement it with whatever technology they have (perhaps bio-organic components).

As they attempt this, they’ll encounter the same engineering challenges human designers did. For example:

* How to implement the tape (memory) in physical form? Maybe their first idea is a literal long strip of some material, but perhaps that is too slow or cannot retain information without continuous power. They might then discover they need **two types of memory**: one that’s fast to access but volatile, and another that’s slower but retains data (this is analogous to our RAM vs. hard drive/storage in computers).

* How to implement the head (the “caret”) that reads and writes symbols? Initial versions might be too large or consume too much power. This challenge mirrors how humans eventually invented the **transistor** to miniaturize and power-efficiently implement logic operations in CPUs.

* The head and circuitry generate heat when performing lots of operations – so they need a way to dissipate heat (hence the large fan in a PC now makes sense – it’s there by design to cool the system).

* How to feed information (input) into the machine and get useful results out (output)? The aliens might not have visual displays, so perhaps they devise some chemical or tactile interface instead of a monitor and keyboard. But fundamentally, they need input/output devices.

In working through these problems guided by the Turing machine concept, the aliens’ *homegrown computer* will end up having analogous components to our PC. It might look very different – perhaps it uses biochemical reactions and partially grown organic parts – but the functional roles will align: a central processing mechanism (like a CPU) that acts as the “head,” a fast-working memory close to it, a long-term storage memory, and I/O mechanisms, all coordinated together. Armed with this experience, the aliens could now look back at our personal computer and identify its parts with understanding: **“Ah, this part must be the processing unit (the caret/head) – it’s even generating heat like ours did. These modules here are fast memory (they’re placed close to the CPU), and those over there are slower storage for data. This spinning thing or silicon board is the long ‘tape’ memory. Those peripherals are input/output devices (which we might not need for our purposes). And this assembly (motherboard and buses) ties everything together.”**

Notice that the aliens achieved understanding **without** having to dissect every transistor or decipher the entire schematic of the PC. By discovering the right *first principle* (the abstract model of computation), they were able to reason about the system from the top-down. If their Turing-machine concept was *correct*, their efforts would face similar constraints and converge to a design that explains the original computer. If their initial guiding principle was *wrong*, however, their constructed machine would diverge in behavior and they’d quickly see it doesn’t resemble the PC at all – a signal to try a different approach.

This example illustrates the power of first principles thinking. A modern personal computer is an astoundingly complex artifact. If we didn’t already know how it works, figuring it out from scratch would be a Herculean task. But **all that complexity stems from a very simple underlying idea** – the ability to systematically manipulate symbols according to rules (which is what a Turing machine formalizes). Once you grasp that core idea, it directs and simplifies your problem-solving process. You still have to engineer solutions, but you know *what the fundamental goal is* (implementing a universal computation device), and that gives you a north star. The first principle in this case (Turing-complete computation) is simple, even if discovering it without prior knowledge might be extremely hard (perhaps akin to an *NP-hard* search problem). Yet history shows that such principles exist for many complex systems – **and finding them can be the key to true understanding**.

### **First Principles in AI Research: Finding the Core of Intelligence**

You might be thinking: *“Well, humans invented computers, so of course we had a first principle (theoretical computer science) to design them. But what about things we didn’t invent?”* A compelling analogy is our quest to understand **natural intelligence** – the human brain and mind. In this scenario, *we* are effectively the aliens trying to comprehend a complex system produced by nature.

We have brains that exhibit intelligence, but we (as a civilization) did not design them; they are a product of biological evolution. The “technological process” that built the brain – millions of years of evolution – is largely opaque to us, and the structure of the brain is incredibly intricate (billions of neurons and trillions of connections). No one handed us a blueprint or “note” saying *“here are the first principles of how intelligence works.”* We’re left to figure it out through observation, dissection, and experimentation. In many ways, understanding the brain is like the aliens trying to reverse-engineer the PC – a daunting task of untangling complexity.

However, if **first principles of intelligence** do exist, finding them would be revolutionary. There is a good chance that the phenomenon of intelligence is based on some fundamental simple principles or architectures. After all, the laws of physics and chemistry that life emerges from are simple and universal; likewise, there may be simple computational or information-theoretic principles that give rise to learning, reasoning, and consciousness.

How can we discover those principles? We have a few approaches:

* **Evolutionary Simulation Approach:** One way is to essentially recreate the process that nature used. For instance, run simulations with artificial life forms or neural networks that mutate and evolve in a virtual environment, hoping that through **natural selection** we end up with agents that exhibit intelligence. In a sense, this is like brute-forcing the solution by replicating the conditions for intelligence to emerge, rather than understanding it upfront. This approach can yield insights, but it’s resource-intensive and indirect – it might produce an intelligent system without telling us clearly *which principles* are at work.

* **Reverse-Engineering the Brain:** Another approach is to directly study biological brains in extreme detail – mapping neural circuits, recording activity, identifying the “wiring diagram” of neurons (the connectome). Projects in neuroscience and AI attempt to simulate brains or parts of brains (like the Human Brain Project or Blue Brain Project). If we can reverse-engineer the brain’s structure and function, we might infer the core mechanisms of intelligence. This is analogous to the aliens scanning the PC chip by chip. It can provide valuable data, but without a guiding theory you end up with loads of details and potential confusion (just as the aliens struggled without the Turing machine concept).

* **First Principles Guessing (Hypothesis-Driven Approach):** The third approach is to **hypothesize** what the simple principles of intelligence might be, build systems based on those guesses, and see if they achieve intelligence similar to humans or at least face similar challenges. Essentially, this is reasoning from first principles: *make an educated guess about the fundamental nature of intelligence, implement it, and test for convergence.* For example, one might guess that **intelligence \= learning \+ goal-driven behavior \+ hierarchical pattern recognition** (just a hypothetical set of principles), and then build an AI with those components. If the AI ends up very unlike human intelligence, then perhaps the guess was missing something or one of the assumed principles was wrong. If the AI starts exhibiting brain-like behaviors or capabilities (even through different means), then perhaps we’re on the right track.

In practice, our journey to **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** will likely involve iterating between these approaches. We might propose a set of first principles, build a system, and observe how it diverges or converges with human-like intelligence. If it fails (diverges significantly), we refine our hypotheses and try again. This is similar to how the aliens would iteratively refine their understanding of the computer by testing designs.

The key mindset here – and why first principles thinking is being emphasized – is that **we need to constantly seek the *core* of the problem**. For AGI, that means not getting lost in the enormity of biological details or blindly copying existing AI systems, but rather asking: *“What is the essence of learning? What is the simplest model of reasoning? What fundamental ability makes a system generally intelligent?”* If we can find abstractions for those, we have our candidate first principles. From there, engineering an intelligent machine (while still challenging) becomes a more guided process, and we have a way to evaluate if we’re on the right path (does our artificial system face the same trade-offs and solve problems in ways comparable to natural intelligence?).

To sum up this example: **complex systems can often be understood by finding a simple foundational principle**. A modern computer’s essence is the Turing machine. Perhaps the brain’s essence will turn out to be something like an “universal learning algorithm” or a simple set of computational rules – we don’t know yet. But approaching the problem with first principles thinking gives us the best shot at discovering such an underpinning, because it forces us to strip away superfluous details and seek the *why* and *how* at the most basic level.

*(As a side note, the example of the computer and Turing machine shows that the first principle, when found, can be strikingly simple. It might be extremely hard to find without guidance – maybe even infeasible to brute force – but once found it often seems obvious in retrospect. This should encourage us in hard problems like AGI: the solution might be elegant, even if finding it is a huge challenge.)*

## **Example 2: First Principles in Our Lives – Core Values and “Dominant” Beliefs**

First principles thinking isn’t only useful in science and engineering; it can also apply to understanding **ourselves**. In effect, each of us has certain fundamental beliefs or values that serve as the *first principles for our mindset and decision-making*. In psychology, these deep-seated foundational beliefs are sometimes referred to as *core beliefs* or *dominant beliefs* (the term “dominant” coming from Russian psychologist Ukhtomsky’s concept of a dominant focus in the mind). These are things we often accept as givens or axioms about life, usually acquired during childhood or through cultural influence, and we rarely think to question them later on.

Your core beliefs act like the axioms on which your brain builds its model of the world. Because they're usually taken for granted, they operate in the background, **shaping your perceptions, interpretations, and decisions** [^8]. In fact, core beliefs "significantly shape our reality and behaviors" [^9] and *"fundamentally determine"* how we act, respond to situations, and whom we associate with [^10]. They are, in a sense, your personal first principles – the basic assumptions from which you construct your understanding of life.

The trouble is, many of these core beliefs might be incomplete, biased, or outright false. We often inherit them from parents, childhood experiences, culture, or even propaganda, without consciously choosing them. And because we seldom re-examine them, they can limit us or skew our worldview. Let’s look at a few examples of such “dominant” beliefs acting as first principles in people’s lives:

### **Example – *“Never Waste Bread\!”***  
 Consider a person who was taught as a child that *throwing away a piece of bread is a terrible wrongdoing*. This belief might come with heavy emotional weight: if you toss bread in the trash, you’re being disrespectful to ancestors who survived famine and war (for instance, elders might invoke the memory of grandparents who endured the siege of Leningrad in World War II, where bread was life or death). In many post-WWII or post-Soviet cultures, this admonition against wasting bread became deeply ingrained.

On the surface, it sounds like a noble value – respect food, remember past hardships. But notice something odd: the same people who insist you **must never throw away bread** often have no issue wasting other food like potatoes, pasta, or rice. If it were purely about respecting the struggle for food, why single out bread versus other wheat products like pasta (which is made from the same grain)? The inconsistency hints that this “never waste bread” commandment might not be an absolute moral truth but rather a culturally planted belief.

Historically, that’s exactly what happened. In the 1960s, long after WWII, the Soviet Union faced grain shortages for various reasons (one being that state-subsidized bread was so cheap people would buy loaves to feed livestock, causing demand to spike). Rather than immediately rationing or raising prices, the government launched a **public campaign urging people to save bread and not throw it away**, wrapping the message in patriotism and remembrance of the war (“Think of your grandparents in the blockade who starved – honor their memory by treasuring every crumb\!”). The emotional appeal stuck. A whole generation internalized this as a core value and passed it to their children. Decades later, grandparents scold grandchildren for tossing out stale bread, invoking WWII – even though the grandchildren live in a time and place where bread is plentiful and the original economic issue no longer exists.

This particular dominant belief is relatively **harmless**. At worst, someone might force themselves to eat old moldy bread out of guilt (and get a stomachache), or just feel bad about food waste. It might even encourage frugality. Many people go their whole lives with this little quirk of not wasting bread and it doesn’t seriously hinder them – and they never realize it originated as essentially a 60-year-old propaganda campaign rather than a universal moral law. It’s a benign example of how a simple idea implanted in childhood can persist as a “first principle” governing behavior, immune to contradiction (e.g., the contradiction that wasting pasta is fine while wasting bread is not is mostly ignored or rationalized).

### **Example – *“The Earth Is Flat.”***  
 Now let’s consider a more obviously problematic core belief. Suppose someone (Freddy) genuinely believes the Earth is flat (and we’ll assume this person isn’t trolling but truly holds this as a fundamental truth). Maybe this belief was influenced by a trusted friend or community. To this person, *“the Earth is flat”* becomes an axiom – a starting point for reality.

On the face of it, one might think “How does this really affect someone’s life? We don’t usually need to personally verify Earth’s shape in daily activities.” But a strongly held belief like this can have **far-reaching consequences on one’s worldview**. Our brains crave a consistent model of the world – the fancy term is we want to avoid **cognitive dissonance**, the mental discomfort of holding conflicting ideas. So if *Flat-Earth Freddy* holds this as an unshakeable first principle, he must reconcile it with the fact that virtually all of science, education, and society says Earth is round. How to resolve this giant discrepancy?

The only way to maintain the “flat Earth” belief is to assume there’s a massive, *pervasive conspiracy*. Freddy might conclude that *all* the world’s governments, scientists, astronauts, satellite companies, airlines, textbook publishers – basically everyone – are either fooled or actively lying. He might split the world into three groups:
1. the enlightened few who know the Earth is flat (and thus can be trusted),
1. the conspirators who actively propagate the globe lie (villains like NASA, astronomers, etc.), and
1. the vast masses of people who are simply duped by the conspiracy (pity them). In Freddy’s mind, this is the only way to explain why “everyone else” disagrees with his core belief. It’s not that *the belief is wrong* (he won’t allow that thought); it’s that reality itself must be arranged in an elaborate deception.

Imagine the world such a person lives in: it’s a world charged with paranoia and cynicism. Nothing can be taken at face value — a sunset, a satellite photo, a GPS reading, even a trip on an airplane — all evidence must be re-interpreted to fit the flat Earth model. Perhaps he decides photos from space are faked in studios, airline routes are actually curved illusions, physics is sabotaged by secret forces, and so on. This is not a trivial impact: it means **trust** in institutions and experts is obliterated (though, to be fair, too much trust can play its own cruel joke). The person will likely isolate themselves from information or people that contradict their view (after all, those sources are “compromised”). They may gravitate only to communities that reinforce the belief (which is not inherently a bad thing either).

Psychologically, what's happening is that the *dominant belief is protecting itself*. Core beliefs are notorious for doing this – they act as filters on perception. Such a person will instinctively cherry-pick anything that seems to support the flat Earth idea and dismiss anything that challenges it. In cognitive terms, a dominant belief "attracts evidence that makes it stronger, and repels anything that might challenge it" [^11]. Even blatant contradictions can be **twisted** into supporting the belief if necessary, because the mind will contort facts to avoid admitting its deeply held assumption is wrong [^12]. For example, if a flat-earther sees a ship disappear hull-first over the horizon (classic evidence of curvature), they might develop a counter-explanation like "it's a perspective illusion" or claim the ship is actually not that far – anything other than conceding the Earth's surface curved.

The result is a warped model of the world full of evil conspirators and fools. Clearly, this will affect life decisions: Flat-Earth Freddy might avoid certain careers (he’s not going to be an astronomer or pilot\!), he’ll distrust educated experts (since they are likely in on “the lie”), and he might form social bonds only with those who share his belief or at least his anti-establishment mindset. He is less likely to engage with or learn from people in scientific fields or anyone who might inadvertently threaten his belief. In short, a false first principle like this can **significantly derail one’s intellectual development and social connections**. The tragedy is that it’s entirely possible for him to personally test and falsify the flat Earth idea (there are simple experiments with shadows or pendulums, etc.), but the dominant belief often comes bundled with emotional or identity investment (“only *sheeple* think Earth is round; I’m one of the smart ones who see the truth\!”), which makes questioning it feel like a personal betrayal or humiliation. So the belief remains locked in place, and the person’s worldview remains drastically miscalibrated.

This example, while extreme, highlights how a first principle that is **wrong** leads to cascading wrong conclusions. Everything built on that faulty axiom will be unstable. Just as in engineering, if your base assumption is off, the structure of your reasoning collapses or veers off in strange directions.

### **Example – *“Life \= Suffering (and success is sin).”***  
 For a final example, let’s examine a subtle yet deeply impactful core belief observed in certain cultures or subcultures: the belief that *we are meant to live in suffering and poverty, and that striving for a better, happier life is somehow immoral or doomed*. In some traditional or religious contexts, there is the notion that virtuous people humbly endure hardship; conversely, if someone is *not* suffering (i.e., if they are thriving, wealthy, or very happy), they must have cheated, sold their soul, or otherwise transgressed. In essence, *success is suspect*. Let’s call this the **“suffering dominant.”**

If a person internalizes the idea that seeking success, wealth, or even personal fulfillment is wrong (or pointless because “the system is rigged” or “the world is evil”), it will profoundly shape their life trajectory. Consider how this first principle propagates through their decisions:

* **Avoiding opportunities:** They might refuse chances to improve their situation. Why take that higher-paying job or promotion if deep down they feel it’s morally better (or safer) to remain modest and struggling? For instance, they may think a higher salary will make them greedy or a target of envy. Or they might avoid education and self-improvement because rising above their peers could be seen as being “too proud” or betraying their community’s norms.

* **Self-sabotage:** Even if opportunities arise, the person may unconsciously sabotage their success. Perhaps they start a small business but, believing that businesspeople inevitably become corrupt, they mismanage it or give up just as it starts doing well. Or they don’t network or advertise because part of them is ashamed to succeed where others haven’t.

* **Social pressure:** Often, if this belief is common in their community, anyone who *does* break out and find success is viewed with suspicion or resentment. The community might even actively pull them back down (the “crab in a bucket” effect) – giving warnings like “Don’t go work for those evil corporations” or “People like *us* never make it big; if someone does, they probably sold out or broke the rules.” The person faces a risk of being ostracized for doing too well.

* **Perception of others:** They will likely view wealthy or successful people as villains – greedy, exploitative, or just lucky beneficiaries of a rigged system. This reinforces the idea that to be a good person, one must remain poor or average. Any evidence of a successful person doing good can be dismissed as a rare exception or a facade.

* **Political and economic stance:** On a larger scale, a group of people with this dominant belief might rally around movements that promise to tear down the “unfair” system entirely (since they don’t believe gradual personal improvement within it is possible or righteous). While fighting injustice is noble, doing so from a belief that **all** success \= corruption can lead to destructive outcomes that don’t distinguish good success from bad.

Historically, mindsets like this did not come from thin air – they often stem from periods of oppression or scarcity. For example, under certain regimes (like Stalinist USSR), anyone who was too successful, too educated, or even simply too *different* risked persecution. In such environments, keeping your head down and showing humility wasn’t just virtuous, it was necessary for survival. “Average is safe; above-average is suspect.” Those conditions can seed a cultural belief that prosperity invites danger or moral compromise. The irony is in a freer, more prosperous society, that old belief becomes a shackle that holds people back. What once (perhaps) saved lives in a dictatorship by encouraging conformity can later prevent people from thriving in a merit-based system.

The *“life is suffering”* dominant belief paints the world in very dark hues: a place where any joy or success is temporary or tainted, where the only moral high ground is to suffer equally with everyone else. It can cause individuals to **actively avoid positive change**. If you believe having a better life will make you a sinner or a target, you’ll ensure you never have a better life. Sadly, those with this belief might even sabotage *others* around them who attempt to improve – not out of malice, but because they think they’re *protecting* their loved ones from risk or moral peril (“Don’t start that crazy project; it will never work and you’ll just get hurt” or “Why study so hard? The system won’t let people like us succeed, and if you do they’ll just exploit you.”). Entire communities can thus stay trapped by a self-fulfilling prophecy, generation after generation.

These examples show how core beliefs operate as first principles in our psychology. They are simple “truths” we often accept without proof: *Bread must be respected.* *The earth is flat.* *Suffering is noble.* Each is a lens that drastically changes how we interpret reality. If the lens is warped, our whole worldview and life outcomes become warped along with it; and when the underlying mental model of reality is wrong, suffering is inevitable.

### **How to Identify and Re-Evaluate Your Core Beliefs**

Unlike a computer or a mathematical puzzle, we can’t plug our brains into a scanner and print out a list of “here are your first principles.” Identifying our own deep beliefs is tricky precisely because they *feel* like just “the way things are.” However, it’s possible to bring them to light with conscious effort. Here are some approaches to finding and testing those fundamental assumptions in thinking:

* **Start from a Clean Slate (Begin at Physics):** One exercise is to **imagine you know nothing and have to derive understanding from scratch.** Start with basic physical truths (e.g., *the laws of physics, observable reality*) and try to build your worldview step by step. This thought experiment can reveal where you’ve been assuming something without evidence. For example, if you assumed *“X is obviously bad”*, ask *“Why? Is it against some fundamental law or did I just learn it somewhere?”* By rebuilding knowledge from first principles, you may spot which “facts” in your mind are actually inherited beliefs.

* **Embrace Radical Doubt:** Adopt the mindset that *anything you believe could be wrong*, and see how you would justify it afresh. This doesn’t mean becoming permanently skeptical of everything, but temporarily suspending your certainties to re-examine them. Explain your beliefs to yourself as if they were new concepts you’re scrutinizing. This method is similar to Descartes’ *Cartesian doubt* – systematically question every belief to find which ones truly are indubitable. Many will survive the test, but some might not.

* **Notice Emotional Reactions:** Pay attention to when an idea or question provokes a **strong emotional reaction** in you – especially negative emotions like anger or defensive feelings. Often, the strongest emotional responses are tied to core beliefs (or past emotional conditioning). If merely hearing an alternative viewpoint on some topic makes your blood boil, it’s a sign that belief is more emotional axiom than rational conclusion. That doesn’t automatically mean the belief is wrong, but it means it’s worth examining why it’s so deep-seated and whether it’s rationally grounded or just emotionally imprinted (perhaps by propaganda or upbringing).

* **Seek Diverse Perspectives:** Actively **listen to other smart people** and note what their core values or assumptions are. If someone you respect holds a belief that you find strange or disagree with, instead of dismissing it, ask *why do they consider that important?* Exposing yourself to different philosophies can highlight your own ingrained assumptions. For instance, if you grow up being taught “success is evil” but then meet successful individuals who are kind and charitable, it challenges that core belief. Use these encounters to update your model of the world.

* **Use the Superposition Mindset:** Not every idea must be accepted or rejected immediately. If you encounter a concept that is intriguing but you’re unsure about, allow yourself to hold it in a **“maybe” state**. Think of it like quantum superposition for beliefs – it’s neither fully true nor false for you yet. Gather more data over time. Many people feel pressure to form an instant opinion (especially on hot topics), but it’s perfectly rational to say “I’m not convinced either way about this yet.” Keeping an open, undecided mind prevents you from embracing or dismissing important first principles too hastily.

* **Beware of Groupthink and Toxic Influences:** Core beliefs often spread through **repetition and social reinforcement**. If you spend a lot of time in an environment (physical or online) that pushes certain views, they can sink in unnoticed. Try to step outside your echo chambers. Also, distance yourself from chronically negative or toxic voices – even if you think you’re just tuning them out, over time negativity and cynicism can become part of your own outlook. Be intentional about which ideas you allow regular space in your mind.

* **Test “Obvious” Truths:** A good rule of thumb: if you catch yourself thinking “Well, that’s just obviously true, everyone knows that,” *pause and ask* “Why is it obvious? Is it actually true, and what’s the evidence?” A lot of inherited first principles hide behind the shield of “obviousness.” For example, “you must go to college to be successful” might be a societal given – but is it a fundamental truth or just a prevalent notion? Challenge such statements, at least as a mental exercise.

* **Identify Inconsistencies:** Look for internal contradictions or things that bother you. In the bread example, the person noticed “Why only bread and not pasta? That doesn’t logically add up.” Those little nagging inconsistencies are clues that a belief might be arbitrary or outdated. If something in your worldview feels “off” or like a double standard, trace it down and interrogate it.

* **Perspective Shifting:** Practice viewing a problem or scenario from **different perspectives**, especially ones rooted in different core values. For instance, consider how an issue (say, wealth distribution) looks if you assume “striving is good” versus if you assume “contentment with little is good.” Or how education appears if you value free-thinking highly versus if you value obedience. By mentally switching out first principles, you become more aware of how they influence outcomes, and you might discover a mix that fits reality better.

* **Continuous Reflection:** Our beliefs aren’t set in stone – or at least, they shouldn’t be. Make it a habit to periodically **audit your beliefs**. You can do this through journaling, deep conversations, or just quiet thinking. Pick a belief and ask: *“Do I have good reasons for this? Does evidence still support it? Where did I get it from? What if the opposite were true?”* Life experiences will provide new data; be willing to update your “priors” – the fundamental assumptions – in light of new evidence. A first principle isn’t sacred; it’s only useful so long as it appears to reflect truth.

Finally, **recognize that finding and refining your first principles is an ongoing process**. You might uncover one, adjust it, and see improvements in how you think and make decisions. Then later, you might find an even deeper assumption behind that one. It’s a bit like peeling an onion. And when you do replace a core belief, it can be disorienting (this is sometimes called an “existential shock” if the belief was central to your identity), but it’s also empowering – it means you’ve grown in understanding.

In summary, **become the conscious architect of your own mind’s first principles**. Don’t let them be merely a product of the environment or your past. As much as possible, choose them wisely after careful reflection. This way, the foundation of your thinking will be solid and aligned with reality, rather than a shaky mix of hand-me-down assumptions.

## **Conclusion**

Whether we are designing a rocket, puzzling over a strange piece of alien technology, or striving to understand our own minds, first principles thinking is a powerful tool. It forces us to cut through complexity and noise, down to the bedrock truths. From there, we can rebuild with clarity and purpose. The examples we explored show how first principles can illuminate almost any domain:

* In technology, identifying the simple theoretical model (like the Turing machine for computers) can guide us to understand and innovate even the most elaborate systems.

* In the pursuit of AI and understanding intelligence, searching for the fundamental principles of cognition may be our best path to truly creating or comprehending an intelligent system.

* In our personal lives, examining our core beliefs can free us from inherited constraints and enable us to live more authentic and effective lives. By challenging false or harmful “axioms” in our thinking, we essentially debug the code of our mind.

First principles thinking isn’t about being contrarian for its own sake or rejecting all tradition. It’s about **honesty in inquiry** – being willing to ask “why” until you reach the bottom, and being willing to build up from zero if needed. It’s also about having the courage to let go of ideas that don’t hold up to fundamental scrutiny. This approach can be mentally taxing (it’s often easier to just follow existing paths), but the reward is deeper understanding and often, breakthrough solutions.

For those of us aiming to solve hard problems – like building artificial general intelligence or unraveling the brain’s mysteries – first principles thinking is not just an option, it’s a necessity. When venturing into the unknown, we can’t rely solely on analogy or incremental tweaks; we have to charter our course from the basics we know to be true. As we’ve seen, even if the first principles we choose aren’t perfectly correct, they give us a reference to test against reality and adjust.

In practice, progress will come from a dance between creative conjecture and rigorous verification. We guess the core principles, implement and experiment, then observe how reality responds. If we’re lucky and insightful, we’ll hit on simple rules that unlock expansive possibilities – much like how mastering a handful of physical laws has allowed humanity to engineer marvels. If not, we refine our hypotheses and try again.

In closing, remember this: **every complex achievement stands on a foundation of simple principles.** By seeking those principles in whatever we do, we align ourselves with the very way knowledge and the universe itself builds complexity out of simplicity. Keep asking "why does this work?" and "what is really going on at the fundamental level?" – and you'll be in the mindset to discover truths that others might overlook. That is the essence of first principles thinking, and it's a mindset that can help crack the toughest problems, one basic truth at a time.
