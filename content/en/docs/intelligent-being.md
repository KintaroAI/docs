## The mental model (7 rules)

1. **Price your energy (body & brain).**
   Treat attention, willpower, and time as fuel. If an action/thought loop doesn’t improve your model or options, it’s a leak.

2. **Chase information gain (IG) per unit energy.**
   Prefer experiments that sharply reduce uncertainty over ones that just confirm what you already think.

3. **Protect your viability set.**
   Keep buffers (sleep, cash, health, relationships). If a tactic lowers risk today but shrinks tomorrow’s options, it’s not intelligent.

4. **Fight dark-rooming.**
   Schedule small, regular doses of novelty you can learn from (new contexts/people/problems) instead of polishing the same inputs.

5. **Update models, don’t just control inputs.**
   When stressed, notice the urge to avoid/scroll/ritualize. Ask: “What would I need to learn so avoidance becomes unnecessary?”

6. **Prefer reversible moves and tool-building.**
   Take cheap, reversible steps first; build tools and habits that lower future energy costs.

7. **Test out-of-distribution.**
   Periodically evaluate yourself in slightly changed conditions; good predictions transfer.

## Daily micro-checklist (60 seconds)

* What’s my **single highest IG/energy** experiment today?
* What loop am I in that feels good but teaches nothing?
* Did I invest in **buffers** (sleep/health/cash/social) today?
* What belief would most change my plan if false—and how will I test it?
* Did I do one **reversible** step toward a bigger bet?
* What changed in my world that my model hasn’t absorbed yet?

## Weekly cadence

* **Perturbation test:** work once in a new location/context; review what broke.
* **Prediction audit:** write 3–5 forecasts with numbers; score them next week (Brier/log loss).
* **Option audit:** list new options created this week (skills, contacts, assets). If the list is thin, you’re trending “dark room.”

## Red flags (kill-switch cues)

* Falling **novelty with rising confidence**.
* More time optimizing inputs (feeds, rituals, dashboards) than updating beliefs.
* Energy trending down while predictions feel “clean.”

## Positive extremes—use, don’t be used

* High novelty drive → harness with time boxes and “evidence required” gates.
* Deep focus → schedule small reality probes to prevent brittleness.
* Threat sensitivity → pair with deliberate disconfirmation to avoid over-pruning.

If you remember just one line: **Invest your limited energy where it most increases tomorrow’s choices *and* makes your forecasts better under small surprises.**
