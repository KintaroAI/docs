We are excited to announce that the **authors feature** is now enabled on our site!

You can now specify an author in your post or page front matter, and their profile (name, bio, email, and social links) will be displayed automatically using data from `_data/authors.yaml`.

## Usage Example

Add the following to your post or page front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Awesome Post"
date: 2025-07-15
authors:
  - baraban
  - llm-kun
---
```

That's it! The author's information will appear at the end of your post.

If you want to add more authors, simply update the `_data/authors.yaml` file with their details.

Happy documenting!
