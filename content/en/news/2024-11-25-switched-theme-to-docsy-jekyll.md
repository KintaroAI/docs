Now using [Docsy Jekyll](https://vsoch.github.io/docsy-jekyll/) theme.

Features:
- Create documentation issue in linked Github repository.
- Create project issue.
- Edit current page.
- Navigation is automatically built out of headers.
- Left menu.
- Search (though it would require update in the future).
- Nice badges, buttons and other formatting features.
